# Installation

There are several ways to install Comtrya on a system; cargo, shell script, provided binaries, or package managers. Comtrya can also be built from source.

## Cargo installation

If your system has the Rust programming language tools such as cargo. Cargo can be used to fetch the source and build a binary on your machine placing it in location accessible by your path environment variable. First, ensure that the Rust programming language tool is installed by running the following:

```
cargo --version
```

You should see the version of cargo installed on your system printed out. If you get an error or nothing, please get the Rust tooling if this is your perferred path from the [Rust Website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once you have cargo and rustc on your system, you can fetch the sources and build with the following command:

```
cargo install comtrya
```

## Shell Script

A shell script is provided to fetch a pre-compile comtrya binary and it install it onto your system. To do this, in your terminal or command prompt, run the following line:

```
curl -fsSL https://get.comtrya.dev | sh
```

Or, optionally, you can get a specific version of comtrya using the following one-liner:

```
VERSION=v0.8.8 curl -fsSL https://get.comtrya.dev | sh
```

## Precompile-binaries

Pre-compiled binaries are also included on our [github repository](https://github.com/comtrya/comtrya) under our [releases](https://github.com/comtrya/comtrya/releases/).

## Package managers

Some package managers may provide comtrya. Check with your package manager. As of this time, comtrya is provided both by Arch in the AUR and Ravenports. If you are interested in packaging comtrya for another package manager, feel free to reach out to the team by opening an issue on our github for support.

## Building from source

Building from source should be a straight forward task for anyone familiar with the Rust toolchian. It is recommended that you go through the [cargo book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) and have some familiarity. Outside of that, it is simply cloning our repository and building. However, it is important to note that you may need to ensure you have the development libraries for openssl installed on your system. Check with your operating system and package manager what what these packages are as they can often vary in naming between different systems.
