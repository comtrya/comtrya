## Package Providers

Packages is a group of actions that utilize the local system's package manager, however it is a bit special. Unlike some other actions, packages can also contain *providers*. Some systems may have multiple package managers that may work on the system and this allows the user choice for what package manager on their system they use. As an example, macOS will automatically utilize homebrew as the default package manager, but this default can be overridden for another package manager on the system such as pkgin, which also supports macOS or macports.

### Supported package providers

Not all package managers are supported. This is a list of currently supported package providers. If you would like support to be added for a package provider, feel free to contribute the support or request support in the [repository](https://github.com/comtrya/comtrya) issue tracker.

| Provider   | OS                |
|:-----------|:------------------|
| pacman/yay | Arch              |
| apt        | Debian/Ubuntu     |
| pkg        | FreeBSD           |
| pkgin      | NetBSD (Multiple) |
| brew       | macOS             |
| winget     | Windows           |
| xbps       | Void Linux        |
| zypper     | OpenSUSE          |
| macports   | macOS             |
| dnf        | Fedora            |


### Important note on homebrew and macOS

Some package manager providers can implement a `bootstrap` method that will automatically configure the package manager on the system. This is most applicable with macOS. Comtrya can automatically install `homebrew` to a macOS system and will do so if a manifest specifies a `package.install` action and does not overridfe the macOS default of homebrew.

### Example

```
# Install package using default provider
- action: package.install
  name: curl
  
# Install a list of packages using default provider
- action: package.install
  list:
  - curl
  - wget

# Install a package using a specific package provider
- action: package install
  name: curl
  provider: pkgin
  
# Install a package specifying a repository
- action: package.install
  name: blox
  provider: homebrew
  repository: cueblox/tap
```

### Local package install support

Some package providers allow for the ability to install a package from the local file system. An example of this would be `.pkg` files that can be utilized with FreeBSD's package manager `pkg`. As of this time, it requires that the file property be set in the action's definition.

List of supported package providers:
- pkg (FreeBSD)

If you would like to have this feature supported on another package provider, please open an issue at the [comtrya github](https://github.com/comtrya/comtrya).

#### Example

```
- action: package.instal
  name: /some/path/to/file/nano-8.1.pkg
  file: true
```
