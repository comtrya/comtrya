# Commands

Comtrya offers several commands for use. They can be listed in the terminal by running comtrya with the help command.

```shell
comtrya help
```

The most frequently used command s the **apply** command, which will apply the actions of provided manifests to the system.

## Available Commands

| Command         | Description                                  |
|:----------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| apply           | Apply manifests                              |
| status          | List manifest status                         |
| version         | Print version information                    |
| contexts        | List available contexts                      |
| gen-completions | Auto generate completions                    |
| help            | Print out help information for using comtrya |

## Apply

The apply command executes and runs the manifests. There are a few ways to do this.

The first option is to point comtrya to a directory of manifests and have it execute them all:

```shell
comtrya -d ./manifests apply
```

As shown, this is done with the `-d` option, which tells comtrya the directory that contains the manifests to be applied.

The second option is to specify specific manifest(s) to be executed:

```shell
comtrya apply -m one,two,three
```

The `-m` option is used to let comtrya know which manifests to apply. Note that the name of the manifest (i.e. one.yaml) is only the name and must not contain any path information or file extension (.yaml). So, `/manifests/one` is not a valid input. Any manifests are expected to be located in the directory of the manifests you specified.

Suppose you have a directory `manifests/` that contains the manifests `one.yaml` and `two.yaml`. You want to *only* execute `one.yaml`. There are three ways to achieve this. You can simply specify the manifest if it's in the current working directory:

```shell
cd manifests/
comtrya apply -m one
```

Or you can specify the directory:

```shell
comtrya -d manifests/one.yaml apply
```

Alternatively a combination of the two is possible as well:

```shell
comtrya -d manifests/ apply -m one
```

## Contexts

The **contexts** command is useful to see what comtrya knows about your system. This can be environment variables, included variables, information about the OS, user information and other variables. Below is an exmaple of the output.

```text

You can also view the values that these contexts have by passing in a `show-values` option as demonstrated below:

```shell
comtrya contexts --show-values
```

## Status

The **status** command provides an overview of manifests.

| Manifest          | Count of Actions |
| :---------------- | :--------------- |
| kubectl.krew      | 3                |
| kubectl.kubesess  | 3                |
| kdash.kdash       | 1                |
