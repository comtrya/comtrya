# Commands

- command.run

## command.run

This is the most basic, but yet powerful action as it can be used to run anything needed that is not directly supported in comtrya by an action. An alias exists, allowing you to abbreviate `command` as `cmd`.

### Scoped environment variables

Sometimes, environment variables are needed to run a command or set of commands. As of v0.9.1, Comtrya will has the ability to inject environment variables for the scope of a single `command.run` action. An initializer will run prior to the action to inject the environment variables, then after the command run finished, a finalizer will remove those from the environment. In the manifest, the environment is implemented as a hash map of keys and values. Multiple environment variables are supported.

### Example

```yaml
- action: command.run
  dir: .
  command: echo
  args:
  - Hello world

# we should see the GOBIN set in the go env output now
- action: command.run
  command: go
  args:
    - env
  env:
    GOBIN: /Users/test

# we should see that GOBIN is no longer set, showing that the variable has been cleaned up
- action: command.run
  command: go
  args:
    - env
```
