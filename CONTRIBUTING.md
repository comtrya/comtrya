# How to contribute

Thanks for reading this document!

## Prerequisites
- Rust (e.g. via `rustup install stable`)
- Cargo (with `fmt`, `clippy` and `nextest`):
  - `rustup component add rustfmt`
  - `rustup component add clippy`
  - `cargo install cargo-nextest`

## Code style
Before you create a PR, just run `check.sh`:
- This will format your code via `fmt`
- Runs the linter `clippy`
- Runs all tests via `nextest`
